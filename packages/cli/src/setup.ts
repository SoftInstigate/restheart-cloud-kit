   * The re-check after an apply, allowed a moment to become true.
   *
   * An apply and its check do not always speak to the same process. Installing
   * or initialising a feature runs on the **admin node**, which writes to the
   * tenant's database directly; the check then asks the **service node**, which
   * caches collection metadata for one second by default
   * (`local-cache-ttl`). So a step that genuinely worked can be observed as
   * not-yet-done, and the run halts on a service that is in fact correct — as
   * `stripe collections and indexes initialised` did.
   *
   * The cache is not the whole lag, and sizing this to it was the mistake. An
   * apply like `initFeature` returns once the admin node has *triggered* the
   * work; the service node then creates collections, builds indexes and
   * installs a schema on its own time. Three seconds covered the cache and not
   * the job, so `stripe collections and indexes initialised` still reported
   * `applied, but the check still fails` on a service where it had in fact
   * worked — and the run halted, telling someone their setup was broken when it
   * was merely slow. Re-running showed the step satisfied, which is the shape
   * of a false alarm and not of a failure.
   *
   * A first check with no delay keeps the common case free, and the backoff now
   * ends at fifteen seconds. That is emphatically not a way to turn a wrong
   * step into a passing one: an apply that did not work does not start working
   * at second fourteen. It only buys a slow one the time to finish.
